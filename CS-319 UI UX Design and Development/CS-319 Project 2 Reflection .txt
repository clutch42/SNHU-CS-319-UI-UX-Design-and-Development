What are three (3) things you have learned from your experience with Project Two? The first thing I learned is that people still use flip phones. It was interesting going back in time and designing a UI for them. I also learned that when trying to pickout the most important data out of a database, it really depends on what the user is looking for. The last thing I learned was that when trying to find user stories you really need a way to randomize the users. When I looked at the Kiva borrower stories I was going to just pick the first 5 but somehow all 5 were from the Phillipines, and that isn't representative of the overall group, so I took the first one off 5 different pages and it was much more diverse.
What are two (2) questions you still have about UI/UX design? I didn't incorperate it into my project, but can a UI pick up on a language setting on a flip phone in this example, and have the text in that language? Also, also specifically for a flip phone, how do you implement accessablitity features?
What is one (1) way your earlier questions from Project One were answered? I got a good answer from Professor McNally on when you stop iterative design. It is finished when your user testing success rate hits a pre-determined percentage.
What is one (1) way you will apply your learning from Project Two in the future? I will use what I learned about getting useful data for users out of databases in the future. And I also learned I still love paper prototypes.
